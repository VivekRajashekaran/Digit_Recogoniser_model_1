# Digit_Recogoniser_model_1
Project Overview
This notebook is part of a classification task where handwritten digit images are analyzed, and the correct digit is predicted using machine learning models. The project demonstrates the following:

Data preprocessing.
Model training and evaluation using various classifiers.
Comparison of model performance.

Dataset
Training Dataset: Contains labeled data used for model training.
Test Dataset: Contains unlabeled data for prediction.
Both datasets are loaded in CSV format:
Training file: train.csv
Testing file: test.csv
